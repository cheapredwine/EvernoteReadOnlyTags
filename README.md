# EvernoteReadOnlyTags

Homebrew utility written in C# to set "read-only" behavior (via contentClass) on Evernote notes, via "ReadOnly" (or other user-defined) tag. 

Currently uses auth tokens because the full OAuth path is broken in the Evernote C# SDK.


How to use: 


1. Get an auth token and URL from Evernote and update the app.config. (See app.config for URL to request token.)


1. In Evernote, mark any notes you want to protect with a tag of "ReadOnly" (or whatever else you specify in the app.config).


1. Run this app. Use the -i (interactive) switch to get basic output.

To unset read-only:


1.  Run this app with the -i switch. Enter "Y" to any read-only notes you wish to unprotect.
