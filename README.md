# EvernoteReadOnlyTags

Homebrew utility to set "read-only" attributes (via contentClass) on Evernote notes, via "ReadOnly" (or other user-defined) tag. 

Currently uses dev tokens because the full OAuth path is broken in the Evernote C# SDK.

To remove read-only attributes, run the same console app and indicate which notes to unset.
